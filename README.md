# PrefsGenerator
This python script will help to create a preferences plist file for you that's used with an iOS tweak. It's meant to be used to make quick rough drafts for preferences.

So far, I'v only included cell types that I've used an am familiar with:
```
PSGroupCell, PSSwitchCell, PSSliderCell, PSSegmentCell
```

### Getting Started
This script was made for use with Python3. At the top of the script are a few useful variables such as company name that you can customize. 

### Usage
```
python3 prefs.py
```
The script will ask a couple questions at the start to make the rest of the process quicker. After that, a menu will appear where you can choose which cell type to add next. During the process, anything inside of [] are suggested values; you can press enter to accept these or type your own value instead.
